# one-k-files

This Bash script organizes a collection of 1000 text files (.txt) into sub-folders based on their language names. Each set of 100 files is named with a specific language followed by its sequence number from 1 to 100 (e.g., arabic-1.txt, arabic-2.txt, ..., to arabic-100.txt, english-1.txt, english-2.txt, ..., to english-100.txt, etc.).

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Place the 1000 text files (formatted as described above) in a folder named "files" within the same directory as the script file `organizeing_files_script.sh`.

3. Open a terminal (command prompt) and navigate to the directory containing the script file and the "files" folder.

4. Make the script file executable with the following command:
   ```bash
   chmod +x organize_files.sh
